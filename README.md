An earlier project, I made an inline calculator to practice my using error handling.  
Since then, my skills have develop, so I have redesigned this to make a more efficient code as it takes advantage of the eval method rather than hard coding and manipulating the strings.
I also used this small project to help develop some skills using GUI's and learning to use kivy.
